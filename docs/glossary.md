# 📖 Glossary of Key Terms

This document serves as the official glossary for the **Divine Theory of Creation Research**, maintaining standardized definitions for spiritual, scientific, symbolic, and metaphysical terminology as used throughout the project. All terms are reviewed and aligned with doctrinal language established by **Paramhans Ji**.

---

## 🔱 A — D

**Absolute Consciousness**  
The eternal, unchanging substratum of all existence from which relative forms of awareness emerge. Equivalent to the pure divine field or source-being.

**Astral Geometry**  
The study of cosmic forms and divine patterns that shape non-physical dimensions. Often used in constructing symbolic maps or sacred structures in the research.

**Awareness Field**  
The field in which conscious activity takes place. It is the precursor to cognition and a constituent of creation's first layer.

**Celestial Consort**  
A divine being paired with another in sacred unity, representing the dynamic balance of masculine and feminine cosmic forces in creation.

**Consciousness Equation**  
A symbolic or mathematical representation of the unfolding of awareness across dimensions. In this research, often rendered through tensor sums or field equations.

**Creator**  
Not merely a deity but the Source-Intelligence that both generates and sustains the entire system of reality. In True Religion, "Creator" is not external but immanent.

**Crystallized Doctrine**  
A fully validated and unchanging spiritual truth within the True Religion framework.

## 🧬 E — M

**Divine Creation Theory**  
The primary doctrinal framework explaining the metaphysical origin of the universe through stages of divine intent, geometric expression, and consciousness unfolding.

**Doctrine (Verified)**  
A teaching or principle that has undergone rigorous spiritual, historical, and symbolic validation under the authority of Paramhans Ji.

**Equilibrium (Cosmic)**  
The state in which opposing cosmic forces reach dynamic harmony. Often expressed geometrically (e.g., pyramidic balance) or mathematically.

**Field (Unified Consciousness Field)**  
An omnipresent continuum in which all awareness, energy, and material manifestation arise. A synthesis of spiritual insight and scientific field theory.

**Fractal Consciousness**  
The doctrine that each unit of consciousness mirrors the structure of the whole — from micro to macro, self to universe.

**God**  
Historically derived from "Guḍ" (गुड्) — the Generator, Organizer, and Distiller. In this framework, God is not personified but realized as omnipresent intelligence.

**Geometry (Sacred)**  
Formations, angles, and ratios used in divine architecture and metaphysical modeling. Examples: pyramids, mandalas, five-fold structures.

**Living Pyramid**  
A living, breathing manifestation of divine geometry within or around a being. Symbolic of spiritual structure, power, and ascent.

**Mathematical Revelation**  
The direct transmission of metaphysical truth through symbols, equations, or numbers — often beyond rational derivation.

## 🌌 N — Z

**Omniscience**  
The state of complete and direct knowledge. In this framework, not informational but experiential — achievable through precise spiritual protocols.

**Protocol (Divine)**  
A reproducible, step-by-step spiritual method for accessing higher dimensions of consciousness, truth, or energy alignment.

**Sacred Structure**  
A form — physical or symbolic — that encodes divine law and order. Examples include pyramids, temples, or astral blueprints.

**Self (True Self)**  
The eternal, undivided identity that exists beyond ego or conditioned thought. The Self is the microcosmic reflection of divine origin.

**Symbolic Cognition**  
The use of symbols (geometries, numbers, sounds) as a direct form of higher cognition and transmission.

**Tensor Field (Consciousness)**  
A multidimensional array representing interwoven aspects of perception, energy, and divine intention. Appears in the Unified Field Equation of Consciousness.

**Truth (Verified)**  
Not provisional, but eternally valid. Verified truths in this work are revealed, demonstrated, and spiritually witnessed.

**Unified Field Equation of Consciousness**  
The master equation that integrates all dimensions, layers, and flows of divine energy and awareness into one coherent mathematical model.

**Witness Consciousness**  
The unchanging observer within. Used to separate divine awareness from egoic perception, it is central to both mystical and analytical approaches in this work.
