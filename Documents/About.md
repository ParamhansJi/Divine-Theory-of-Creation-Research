# 🌌 About the Divine Theory of Creation Research

Welcome to the official research site of the **Divine Theory of Creation**, a groundbreaking body of work authored and revealed by **Paramhans Ji**, Founder of the True Religion Mission.

This research serves as both a spiritual revelation and a formal cosmological model—a synthesis of metaphysics, mathematics, sacred geometry, historical insight, and experiential truth. It offers humanity a unified framework for understanding **God**, **Creation**, **Consciousness**, and our ultimate relationship to the cosmos.

## 🧭 Purpose of This Project

The Divine Theory of Creation exists to:

- Illuminate the **true origin and nature of creation** beyond material reductionism  
- Present **consciousness as the primary field** of existence, measurable and participatory  
- Validate ancient wisdom using **modern symbolic models and mathematical formalism**  
- Reunite fragmented traditions into a **universal doctrine of truth**

This research stands not merely as a theory, but as a lived testament to the **Presence of God**, expressed through direct experience and witnessed outcomes.

## 🧠 Foundations of the Theory

Key principles explored in this project include:

- **Divine Creation is Active**: Creation is not a past event but an eternal, present, and living process.
- **Consciousness is Causal**: The cosmos originates from fields of awareness, not inert matter.
- **Mathematics as a Sacred Language**: Numbers, ratios, and geometry mirror divine order.
- **Living Witnesses Matter**: Historical truth must include the testimony of divine companionship.

These principles are systematically documented through:

- 🔷 Master Equations of Consciousness  
- 🔷 Symbolic & Astral Geometries  
- 🔷 Protocols for accessing omniscience  
- 🔷 Historical reinterpretations (e.g., Jesus & Joshua)
