# Divine Theory of Creation Research

**Repository:** *Divine‑Theory‑of‑Creation‑Research*  
**Founder & Lead Researcher:** Paramhans Ji

---

## 📘 Project Overview

This repository contains the foundational research, conceptual frameworks, mathematical models, and translational content relating to the **Divine Theory of Creation** as articulated by Paramhans Ji, founder of True Religion. The work explores the nature of universal consciousness, creation dynamics, sacred geometry, and practical protocols for accessing omniscient wisdom.

---

## 🧭 Purpose & Objectives

The primary aim is to document and disseminate a rigorously structured theory of cosmic origination rooted in systematic spiritual investigation. It presents:

1. Empirical‑metaphysical studies on consciousness and creation  
2. Mathematical or logical models illustrating divine principles  
3. Protocols for living in alignment with divine presence  
4. Historical and cross‑tradition comparisons of creator archetypes
